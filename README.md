# Genesis

This project is a web application developed for UGAHacksX.

This project, Genesis, is developed as a Kickstarter-like application with the purpose of allowing users to pioneer their own projects. These projects enable patrons to contribute cryptocurrency to help developers fund the costs of their projects. Genesis offers patrons the unique ability to control how their money is used, as the contribution pool of a project is not entirely released to the developer until the full contribution goal is reached. Before this time, a small percentage will be available to the developer while the rest remains locked up. To provide contributors with additional security throughout the course of the project, patrons can vote to cancel a project if it is not meeting their expectations. If a majority of the contributors vote to cancel a project, the remaining amount in the contribution pool is refunded to the crypto wallets of the patrons.

# Challenges
- Pinata: To develop the systems to store, retrieve, and update information within the timeframe of the hackathon. 
- Smart Wallet: To do the calculations of crypto exchange, structuring the smart wallets systems, and utilizing the modifiers efficiently.
